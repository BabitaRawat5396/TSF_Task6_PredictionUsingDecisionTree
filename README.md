In this repository we are Predicting using Decision Tree Algorithm on [Iris Dataset](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox).
## Decision Tree
Decision Tree is type of Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. That is you explain what the input is and what the corresponding output is in the training data. The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves.
The goal of using Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from training data.
__Task__ : Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
